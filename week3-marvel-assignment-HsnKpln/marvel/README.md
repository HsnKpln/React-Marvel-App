 **1.** https://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/characters , I pulled data from API using url. I created 12 cards with the limit and offset feature and printed it on the screen.
 **2.** I made the pagination part by proportioning the data I could get from the API to what I wanted to print on the screen. I pulled the relevant data for each increasing or decreasing number and printed it on the screen.
**3.** After making the necessary arrangements with pure CSS, I edited the page responsively with the CSS Grid and media screen feature.  
**4.** I saved the data of the clicked pages to local storage. When returning to the same page again, I used the data in local storage and prevented the page from being refreshed.
